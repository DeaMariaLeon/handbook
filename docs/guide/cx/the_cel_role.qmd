What is the Contributor Experience Lead‚Äôs role in an Open Source project?



The Contributor Experience Lead owns a part of what some of us have referred 
to so far as Community, Communication, and Documentation work. But not only 
those! ü§Ø They have several areas of contribution, and as their contributions 
grow in prominence within the project they may very well be recognized as a 
maintainer, with contributions to code, and social infrastructure - and a 
focus on project sustainability. 



What do we mean by that? The Contributor Experience Lead has 4 areas of 
activity, and a broad range of skills to achieve results. Let‚Äôs break this 
down.



## Areas of activity

- Onboarding
- Tools Integration
- Outreach
- Governance


By working in these 4 areas, the Contributor Experience Lead can support new 
and developing contributors as they work on the project. The goal of the 
Contributor Experience Lead is to improve the overall project culture and 
experience for everyone involved, to promote civility and collaboration, as 
well as diversity and inclusion. They look for actions they can take 
themselves, and experiences they can promote in the project as a whole. They 
are learners and need to adapt to the existing people and culture and build 
upon it. No two projects are alike. 



In this guide, we will elaborate about techniques for each area of activity, 
sharing tools, resources, and experiences. Building systems, and providing 
examples to motivate how those systems work in practice in different projects.



## Skills



We are currently developing a career ladder for the Contributor Experience 
Lead. While this is worked on, we can already share the skills we are 
working with. But please consider some changes might still be coming. We are 
following a relatively ‚Äústandard‚Äù engineering career ladder framework. We 
consider all skills which require expertise, training, and domain knowledge 
to be technical skills - even if they are not engineering skills - they 
comprise a set of techniques that one can become an expert in. 



### Core Competencies

#### Leadership:¬†

Strategic networking, Strategy development, Advocacy



#### Communication:

Outreach, Facilitation, Engagement, Cultural Competence, Communication 
platforms management, Speaking & presenting, Promotion of civility, 
Mentoring & coaching



#### Handling and Providing Feedback and Credit:

Feedback gathering, giving, and receiving, Credit for contributors



#### Strategic Alignment & Impact:

Proposal development,¬†Qualitative research, Analysis, Change management



### Technical Skills

Broadly speaking, these skills require competencies in: 
Interpersonal skills, Communication, Culture and DEI, Program development 
and management, Technical skills, Qualitative research



Like many other complex roles, we wouldn‚Äôt expect any one person to be an 
expert in all areas of competence, especially if they are just starting out 
in this role. But they should be aware that this is what the domain requires 
from a team of contributors, and that they would be collaborating with other 
folks who have a variety of skills. They might also be interested to grow 
and develop more broadly, or more narrowly. However, a solitary Contributor 
Experience Lead in a project would benefit from a brand set of skills, and a 
collaborative approach with fellow contributors who could help them along 
the way.
