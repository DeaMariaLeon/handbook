Welcome to our blog! We welcome community contributions about your work and 
thoughts regarding Contributor Experience. Or maybe you have a call to the 
community, or would like to start a discussion with more than 240 characters 
ðŸ˜‰. Think of this as a place to have longer public conversations about how 
the social infrastructure of open source projects. 

If you'd like ot have less public conversations. We will soon launch community 
meetings. Check out our [calendar](../../about/calendar.qmd). Our 
[communication channels](../../about/comms_channels.qmd) will be updated 
shortly as well.
