We currently hold regular informal community meetings to discuss all things 
contributor experience. We are also planning on organizing more structured events 
to collaborate on documentation, host guest speakers, and highlight case studies 
from around OSSverse.  

Join us every Friday at 3pm UTC via [Zoom](https://numfocus-org.zoom.us/j/81082067424?pwd=bVNqWXhqSXZEdTl6ZzFsa1lJZ08xZz09).
Everyone is welcome to attend and contribute to a conversation.
