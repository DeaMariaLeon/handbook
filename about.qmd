The Contributor Experience project was created as an experiment on improving
contributor onboarding, experience, and the implementation of DEI-centered
practices in four large and established open-source projects from the scientific
Python ecosystem (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and pandas).

This work is currently supported by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative as a part of
their [Essential Open Source Software for Science D&I program](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/advancing-an-inclusive-culture-in-the-scientific-python-ecosystem/).

This work is also supported by Quansight and NumFOCUS.
