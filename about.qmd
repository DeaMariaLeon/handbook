The Contributor Experience Project is a community of practice to support and study the emerging field of 
open source contributor onboarding and support. It grew out of the idea to document the insight from the work of 
(in alphabetical order) Inessa Pawson, Melissa Mendon√ßa, and Noa Tamir on improving contributor onboarding and support 
following the DEI-centered practices in four large and mature open source projects in the scientific 
Python ecosystem (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and pandas).

This work is currently supported by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative as a part of
their [Essential Open Source Software for Science D&I program](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/advancing-an-inclusive-culture-in-the-scientific-python-ecosystem/).

This work is also supported by [Quansight](https://quansight.com) and [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/).
